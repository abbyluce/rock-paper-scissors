## Features
- A home page shows on page load with the option for either the Classic or Difficult version of the game. It includes directions for each version, and allows users to click a button to take them to the game board of their choosing.
- Both versions of the game show the fighter options and ask the user to select their play.
- The computer randomly selects their play from the available fighters
- Both the users and computers choices are shown side by side with the subheader at the top displaying who won or if it is a tie.
- The score count is updated based on who won.
- After the winner or a tie is established, the original game board resets after a couple of seconds.
- User can switch between game levels and their scores will remain displayed.

## Possible Future Extensions
  - Ability to login with your name and the subheader to update with your name each time you win.
  - A confetti blast each time the user wins a round.
  - The overall game to end once either the user or computer reaches 10 points, a scoreboard to pop up in a window.
